# TabControlDiffItems
TabItem 1: By clicking the Button "love you", a movement of the bus is initiated.The bus moves forward horizontally and as it reaches the border, it starts moving backwards horizontally and vice-versa. The movement can be started or stopped anytime, which also stops the movement of the bus.

P.S.:The bus changes its color randomly as it moves, which can be a bit irritating to the eyes :)


TabItem 2: A TextBox where one is supposed to input a number that is divisilbe by 7. If the user gives something else, a MessageBoxError pops up and asks you to read the TextBlock correctly. If you enter the right number(any natural number divisible by 7) and click on the Button "Berechnen", the program lists all the factors of the given number in the ListBox. You can either continue with other numbers, or delete the contents of the ListBox using the other Button that says "LÃ¶schen"


TabItem 3: Using the Button "Show/Clear", the user can make three diagonally placed Rectangles appear or disappear.
